I'm thrilled to share that I have just completed my Second Excel data analyst project, creating an insightful dashboard of Amazon delivary analysis! ðŸš€
It includes data on over 43,632 deliveries across multiple cities, with detailed information on order details, delivery agents, weather and traffic conditions, and delivery performance metrics. The dataset enables researchers and analysts to uncover insights into factors influencing delivery efficiency, identify areas for optimization, and explore the impact of various variables on the overall customer experience.
In this project me analyse the delivary based question on dataset :
1)	Which month has most orders.
2)	Which day most sales occur.
3)	What is the order count.
4)	  forcast is good or bad for orders,which forcast have maximum orders.
5)	What is the average delivary time .
6)	Which category have most sale.
7)	What is average rating.
Such type of questions answers are analysed in dataset. 

Working on this project has been an incredible journey, transforming raw data into actionable insights that can drive decision-making and business growth. I leveraged excel tool ,power query to visualize Amazon delivary analysis, uncovering trends and patterns that were previously hidden in plain sight.
